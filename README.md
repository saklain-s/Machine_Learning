## Introduction

Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data, without being explicitly programmed. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms, along with explanations and usage examples.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are included in this repository:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
7. **Naive Bayes**
8. **K-Means Clustering**
9. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
10. **Neural Networks**

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file and includes:

- A brief explanation of the algorithm
- The mathematical formulation
- Code implementation
- Usage examples

## Installation

To use the algorithms in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
