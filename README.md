# Easy ML

Welcome to this repositoryâ€”a curated collection of hands-on programs and projects designed to deepen your understanding of Python's most popular libraries and machine learning applications.


## Folders Overview

- **Matplotlib**:  
  Learn data visualization techniques with programs built from scratch to master basic to advanced plotting and customization.

- **NumPy**:  
  Dive into numerical computations with examples demonstrating array manipulations, broadcasting, and a host of mathematical operations.

- **Pandas**:  
  Explore data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis through well-commented scripts that cover data frames, merging datasets, and time-series analysis.

- **Projects**:  
  Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. Each project includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You'll also need the following libraries:

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) *(for ML projects)*

Install them via pip:

pip install matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn
Cloning and Running
