# Sign Language Recognition with CNN

This project recognizes sign language gestures from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a web interface for predictions.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Training, validation, and test split
- Flask web app for image upload and prediction

## Getting Started
1. Download the dataset (e.g., Sign Language MNIST from Kaggle)
2. Run the preprocessing and training scripts
3. Start the Flask app to use the web interface
